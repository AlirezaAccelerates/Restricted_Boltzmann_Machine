# Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)

This repository contains an implementation of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in Python. The RBM is a type of generative stochastic neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.

## Features

- Initialize and train an RBM with specified visible and hidden units.
- Perform Contrastive Divergence for training.
- Generate samples using Gibbs sampling.
- Reconstruct visible units from hidden states and vice versa.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.
